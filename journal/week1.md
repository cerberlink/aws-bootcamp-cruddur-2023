## Connect DynamoDB and Postresql
Thats challegned for me when I missed something to command postgresql. In the video, it did not work for my side so I figured out how to resolve an issue. Until I saw someone leaving a commment under the video. The command is `psql -h localhost -U postgres`. That command I used works for my side so I am able to connect psql client.
